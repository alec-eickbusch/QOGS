# Quantum Optimal Gate Synthesis (QOGS)


Welcome to the Quantum Optimal Gate Synthesis (*QOGS*) package! Built with Tensorflow and qutip in python. 

**This project is a work in progress and documentation is under developement.** 

If you would like to contribute, or have any issues, comments, or questions, please open a github issue or contact: [alec.eickbusch@yale.edu](mailto:alec.eickbusch@yale.edu).

The method here is an extension of the optimization techniques used in the paper **Eickbusch et al. "Fast universal control of an oscillator with a weak dispersive coupling to a qubit" (2021)** [arXiv:2111.06414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06414) to general parameterized gate sets.
